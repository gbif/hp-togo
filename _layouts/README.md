# Layouts
You can read more about the _layouts folder in the Jekyll documentation https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/

Most site users will not need to add or change anything in this folder. But if you want to extend the theme with your own layouts, then this is the folder to do that. In most cases the recommended approach is to use composable blocks and the `composition` layout. See more in `_includes/blocks/README.md`

Place you own layouts as e.g. `/_layouts/my_own_layout.html`.
