# Footer configuration
# You should create one of these files for each language you support. E.g. /_data/es/footer.yml for the spanish version of the footer
# Footer content is organized in columns.
# You can also add a small print license statement at the bottom.

# Columns (the more you add, the narrower they will be)
columns:
  - name: Column example
    description: | # Can be Markdown and multiline as shown here. 
      This is an example column. You can add as many as you want.
      Each column can have a name, an optional description and optional links.
      You can also enable social icons for a column (e.g. for a "Contact" column).
    links:
    - text: Name of project partner 1
      href: http://example.com
    - text: Name of project partner 2
      href: http://example.com
